# 📏 Fitting a Height Distribution – Jupyter Notebook

This notebook demonstrates how to fit a **probability distribution** to a dataset representing human height measurements. It walks through the steps of statistical modeling and visual analysis using Python.

## 📄 Overview

The notebook includes:
- 📊 Loading and exploring height data
- 🔍 Visualization with histograms and density plots
- 🧮 Fitting a **normal (Gaussian) distribution** to the dataset
- 📈 Plotting the fitted curve over the histogram
- ✅ Goodness-of-fit checks and parameter interpretation

## 💡 Key Concepts

- Probability density functions (PDF)
- Histogram vs. theoretical distribution
- Mean and standard deviation estimation
- Normal distribution modeling
- Curve fitting and distribution overlay

## 🛠️ Dependencies

Make sure you have the following libraries installed:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scipy
